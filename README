POC: Given very large images (10k+), object detector and a payload (
a model/algorithm doing something to the detected objects - CPU bound), 
process images as fast as possible.

Uses threads for IO tasks (reading/writing files, talking to GPU, etc) 
and Ray actors/tasks for CPU intensive computations (payload).

Detector agnostic - plug in any detector as long as it
implements the AbstractDetector interface. 

Payload functions - computationally intensive image processing tasks, say 
determining inclination angle of a detected concrete pole, which involves
quite a bit of loops and operations. Could be defined under payload/ 
Tasks need to be pickable as they will be executed in separate processes 
as Ray tasks.
